Returning to Ubuntu, standard

Gtk standard for gtk apps

Bad: Nazi design principles, to put icons in desktop or to hide topbar, or remove menu  applications from there, or to put favourites in top bar... everything is a hack.

Creating a web bookmark in the favourites is an epic voyage: need to create it in .local/share/applications, with a command like this:  bash c- 'exec chrome url', then download an icon to put in it, then go to applications search, should be there for now

Nautilus: one click option ok, but you cant select on hover so no shift-select possible with the mouse, need to do it by keyboard shift arrow or disable one-click

Also Nautilus doesnt show application menu in its window if application menu is disable in top bar, so no way to access "preferences" -eg to change between one click/double click

Buggy: constantly restarting/freecing the desktop in a day work

Cool: extensions writen in javascript

In 17.10: finally can install extensions from builtin search, not browser plugin...



#kde (e.g. mint 18)
- Out of the box looks good
- Dolphin file explorer is a finished product
- Extensions written in python
- Qt based, not gtk: starting gtk apps is a bit slower.

#xfce
- light, super customizable and super friendly 
- Whiskermenu makes it a fast interface
- Robust
- Bad: if you assign Win key to whiskermenu rest of win-? shortcuts stop working.
- Apparently old technology.
- several places to config similar thing: windows/windows config, workspaces/window workspaces...

#mate
- gtk based
- customizable
- lacks a good whisker menu (brisker menu seems to be coming)

#cinnamon, budgie
- gtk based
- ok to basic use, hard to customize
